    <p class="clearfix"><img class="avatar female" src="images/user-female.png">Tamika lives in the Johnson Homes at 25th &amp; Norris. She hears about myPhillyRising on Facebook. Sounds useful&mdash;it&apos;s usually impossible to find out when the Honickman Center is open. She visits myPhillyRising on her HTC Inspire, and she&apos;s impressed by how much information is right there. Finding this on the city website is way too hard, and some of that information is wrong. She checks out the learning center hours, and sees that there&apos;s a drop-in skills clinic event happening next week as well.</p>
    <p class="clearfix"><img class="avatar male" src="images/user-male.png">Jim lives in Strawberry Mansion. He&apos;s taking part in the Citizen Engagement Academy when it visits the neighborhood in March. He&apos;s keeping an eye on a few vacant buildings on his block, and some of the sessions with city staff sound useful. After hearing about it at a neighborhood meeting, Jim uses myPhillyRising to check when the academy events are going to be, and other events too. He can also check the location&mdash;tomorrow&apos;s event is at the library on 28th St, ok.</p>

    <h3 class="primary-header">Our Approach</h3>
    <p>myPhillyRising will provide information that residents need, in a responsive mobile site.</p>
    <p>OpenPlans will use user testing to guide design decisions, and work closely with the City's Managing Director's office to understand scope needs.</p>
    <p>We will build myPhillyRising using existing open source components, to minimize new development of core features like mapping. The components of the site will have APIs, powering the web client but also providing a data resource for other tools.</p>
    <p>Taking an iterative, open approach to development, we&apos;ll fulfil the needs of the project and set it up for future growth with an open source community.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3 class="primary-header">Features of myPhillyRising</h3>
    <p>Based on our current understanding of the scope of myPhillyRising, here&apos;s our proposed technical approach and features. At the start of the project, we&apos;ll organize an exploratory design workshop to test some of the assumptions we&apos;re making.</p>

    <h4>The Site Design</h4>
    <p>myPhillyRising will be a mobile web app, with a responsive layout. Like this webpage, the components will adjust to any screen size. The interface will be clean and elegant, with appropriate graphic embellishments that render beautifully on all devices.</p>
    <p><img class="multi-devices" src="images/multi-devices.png"></p>

    <p>Design decisions will be driven by user testing. To optimize usability, we&apos;ll get community input on an early beta of the tool.</p>

    <p>Users can log into myPhillyRising with their existing social networks. </p>
    <p><img class="social-network-icon" src="images/facebook-64.png"> <img class="social-network-icon" src="images/twitter-64.png"> <img class="social-network-icon" src="images/google+-64.png"></p>

    <p>Depending on needs, myPhillyRising&apos;s interface can be available in multiple languages. If this gets adopted as a feature, we'll need assistance producing the translated versions of the interface text. Shareabouts, one of the core components we're using, already has multiple language support built in.</p>

    <h4>Explore What&apos;s Nearby</h4>
    <p>A central features of myPhillyRising is the <strong>Map View</strong>&mdash;it shows community facilities like parks, rec centers, health centers, computer labs, etc. Citizens can use their phone&apos;s GPS to find themselves on the map, to identify facilities nearby.</p>
    <p>Users can filter the map to show only what&apos;s open now, or services by type. Different types of location are shown with different icons on the map.</p>
    <p>Clicking a location reveals more information - address, contact info, opening hours, other details.</p>
    
    <p><a href="http://apops.mas.org/"><img class="iphone" src="images/iphone-pops-find-a-pops.png"><img class="iphone" src="images/iphone-pops-1penn.png"><img class="iphone" src="images/iphone-pops-space-details.png"></a></p>

    <p>The myPhillyRising map will be powered by <a href="http://shareabouts.org/">Shareabouts</a>&mdash;a responsive, open source mapping platform. Shareabouts already uses the Leaflet library for speedy mobile mapping, and Django with PostGIS for a dependable backend. We'll extend the admin interface so PhillyRising staff can edit or upload updated map layers as data changes (we'll work with the staff to figure out the lowest-effort way to do this within the constraints of the project budget).</p>
      
    <p>Data from the Shareabouts API will be provided to the mobile map client using geojson. This is the most efficient way for us to connect myPhillyRising to Shareabouts, but it's also a powerful way to open up PhillyRising map locations to other developers. Using the same feed, multiple clients can use the map data for apps, visualizations, analysis and more. </p> 


    <h4>Find Activities, Events, &amp; Meetings</h4>
    <p>The <strong>Events View</strong> shows meetings, workshops and other activities. Users can filter by topic or date, click to RSVP for a meeting, see the meeting location on the map, and subscribe to meeting updates.</p>
    
    <p>Event data is powered by <a href="https://github.com/openplans/meetingmatters">Meeting Matters</a>. Frustrated by the weak ecosystem of data around meetings, we created Meeting Matters to make it easier to find out about and attend meetings. People can add meetings to the database, and subscribe to meeting info by tag and location.</p>
    
    <p>For myPhillyRising, we'll take the core of Meeting Matters and turn it into a simple meeting info aggregator. Partners can add meetings via the Meeting Matters interface, or by adding a link to an existing ical feed to pull in (this is a new feature we will add specifically for myPhillyRising). The Meeting Matters engine will serve GeoJSON and ics feeds of meeting, locations and topics for myPhillyRising - and for other developers to use.</p>

    <h4>Let&apos;s Talk</h4>

    <p>myPhillyRising will include simple discussion tools. Citizens can ask a question or make a comment, categorized by the PhillyRising neighborhoods. Using the mobile tool, users can see new questions or comments in their neighborhood, and reply. People can share discussion threads on social media. Staff can reply from an official account and will be able to moderate comments.</p>
    
    <p>Shareabouts already has commenting built in, for people to discuss places. We'll work with project staff to work out what additional features are needed, and whether our proposal structure of conversations organized by neighborhood makes sense. Another option could be to build in Facebook comments, or another service like Disqus.</p>

    <h4>Points Mean Prizes</h4>
    <p>All activities in the PhillyRising app earn the user points -- checking the app each day, looking up events and places, attending meetings, activity streaks, participating in conversations, sharing places or topics...</p>
    <p>Working with the PhillyRising team, we&apos;ll design a simple leaderboard system that&apos;s calibrated for the kind of engagement that the project wants to promote. To design this requires a discussion where we'll explore the value of the points for PhillyRising and the city. For example, users might track their involvement over all time, and see their local status compared to others in the same neighborhood. Top scoring people can win the opportunity to work with city staff on particular local issues, or get to spend time talking to the Mayor.</p>


    <h2>Future expansion</h2>

    <p>The ideas in this document are just the start of what we imagine tools like myPhillyRising can do for empowered neighborhoods...</p> 
    <p>The solid layer of open source tools we're proposing makes for a flexible tool in the future. As the underlying tools are improved, myPhillyRising can benefit from these new features.</p>

    <p>The scope for this initial round of work is limited. Here are some ideas we would like to explore for future development -</p> 
    <p>More advanced discussion features, including <strong>Q&amp;A tools</strong> that build up a collection of answers, like StackOverflow or other tools from the tech world</p>
    <p>More connections between myPhillyRising and the real world, like a <strong>mobile meeting sign-in tool</strong> that helps event organizers see who's in the room</p>
    <p>Integration with <strong>311</strong> services</p>
    <p>Pull in <strong>more standardized data</strong>, e.g. flu shot locations</p>
    <p>Embed Meeting Matters <strong>widgets</strong> into other sites</p>
    <p><strong>Text message</strong> notifications of events and meetings.</p>
    <p>Add concept of projects/local changes</p>
